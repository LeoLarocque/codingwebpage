    Almost every computer related device uses coding. The first high-level programming language was Plankalk√ºl, created by Konrad Zuse between 1942 and 1945. Now days there are many different forms of coding used for different things. HTML is used to make webpages while Python is commonly used for developing websites and software, task automation, data analysis, and data visualization.

    <p class="Coding">It is easy to learn how to code. If you would like to learn how to program look up the form of code you would like to use and usually there will be a website that teaches it. For example look up Python and you will see they have their own website to teach students like you how to code!
